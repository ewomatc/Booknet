# Booknet
## A Library Application
#### Adopted from Odin Project and MDN's LocalLibrary Project.

Concepts applied include CRUD operations, Model, Views, Controller (MVC).
Frontend uses the Pug Templating Engine.

### Functionalities of the app
Users are able to get a list of all books, authors, and genres, as well as all book instances.
Every text in blue is a link that takes you to the detail page for the particular item.

#### Creating Items
There is no user administration restricting users from creating or deleting items. However, items depend on one another.

Creating a book will therefore require you to create it's author as well as it's genres.
